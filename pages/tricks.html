            <h2>Manual</h2>
            <p>Manual - aka a wheelie. Rolling on the back two wheels of the skateboard. A fun trick that requires a lot of balance. Hold the manual as long as you can.</p>
            <h3>Things to know</h3>
            <p>This trick is all about balance. You need to roll and hold the front wheels off the ground. Don't let the tail touch either.</p>
            <p>The tail can touch and drag as you are rolling. Try not to do this. It will wear down the kick on your skateboard deck. That will kill the pop. The pop comes in handy if you start doing ollie tricks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The do a manual you need to find your balance over the back wheels.</li>
                <li>Place you foot on the tail kick.</li>
                <li>Then put more weight on the tail to lift it. Like you would for a kick turn but without the turn.</li>
                <li>There is a sweet spot with the wheels and tail in the air. You need to find that spot and try to hold it. that is the tricky part</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the more advanced try an ollie into a manual and pop out. Do this up a curb or pad you can ollie up hold the trick until the end and pop off.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get rolling.</li>
                <li>Ollie up over the curb.</li>
                <li>Land in on your back wheels. Placing more weight on the tail to keep the front wheels up.</li>
                <li>Don’t go too far backwards or you will drag the tail.</li>
                <li>Keep those front wheels up.</li>
                <li>When you get to the end of the pad you will pop off like when you roll off a drop.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Try and put a little ollie into it on the way out.</p>
            <h3>Practice your manual</h3>
            <p>To practice. Make markers and try to do a manual from one to the next. Get some speed and try to hold for the width between the lines of a parking space.</p>
            <p>Good luck.</p>

        <div id="ollie">
            <h2>Ollie</h2>
            <p>The skateboard ollie is when you jump and the board sticks to your feet. You can learn how to ollie right here.</p>
            <p>The ollie is the proper name for a skateboard jump. It was first done on a skateboard halfpipe back in 1977. It didn’t look much like what modern street skaters do these days. It took many talented skaters experimenting to learn how to pop ollies on flat ground as high as we do today.</p>
            <h3>Things to know first</h3>
            <p>The ollie is important and one trick everyone wants to learn. There are tons of things to learn before you focus on it. Rolling well. Good balance. Pushing, stopping and turning. Get these easy skateboard tricks figured out first. Then try an ollie.</p>
            <p>Try the basic skateboard tricks too. If you can do them then you will have the balance and coordination needed to ollie. Saving yourself a lot of time sucking at skateboarding. You will get a time savings and you will already know a few tricks too.</p>
            <h3>Learning the ollie</h3>
            <p>Learn the ollie while standing still on pavement or concrete. You don't need to be rolling. But you should learn on a surface that will let you roll back and forth. The hard surface is important to get used to.</p>
            <p>You need to be able to balance on your rolling skateboard if you hope to do this trick. Learning it in place where the wheels do not roll is awkward. Rolling lets you develop balance. If you have learned the basic skateboard tricks then you should have no problem with this.</p>
            <p>Once you can pop the tail on this trick you need to start trying it while rolling. Even rolling slow makes the skateboard ollie work much better. It is easier to do skateboard tricks when rolling there is a good scientific reason why.</p>
            <p>When you are moving in a certain direction your board and your body will continue to move in that direction. This make things stable and easier to control. When rolling your stay lined up over your skateboard.</p>
            <p>The other added bonus is that if you are comfortable rolling when you pop your ollie. You will have the balance to land the ollie and roll away. The moving ollie should be your goal.</p>
            <h3>How to pop the ollie</h3>
            <p>Practice this first:</p>
            <p>Learn these two moves. They give proper foot placement and balance. Then put them together and pull an ollie in no time.</p>
            <p>The jump and the pop:</p>
            <p>The jump<br />While rolling crouch down at the knees. Using your crouched knees, jump up and land back on your board. Crouch for balance!</p>
            <p>The pop<br />While standing still on the skateboard, pop the tail by hitting it down on the ground hard. Stay on the board</p>
            <p>Get these two down solid. Make sure your can jump and land without falling off. This gives you all the balance you need to land the ollie. Get so you can smack the tail hard on the ground. This will allow you to pop the board off the ground.</p>
            <p>Doing these two steps together with the proper timing will give you a good skateboard ollie.</p>

            <h2>Fakie Kickturn</h2>
            <p>Fakie Kickturn - Riding fakie, switch or backwards and doing a kickturn to your normal stance. This is the first time you will completely change the direction you are rolling while on the skateboard.</p>
            <h3>Things to know</h3>
            <p>You want to start doing this trick frontside. That means you will be rotating and facing in the direction you are rolling. You will be facing forward the whole time.</p>
            <p>Lets get started:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start rolling backwards.</li>
                <li>Get into kickturn stance on the front of the board instead of the back. It may feel a little awkward.</li>
                <li>Wind up your body and get ready to do a kicturn from the front. Remember you will be turning and facing forward during the turn.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Figure out where your body will be going before you start the turn. This move is easy to do in the physical sense but really hard to get straight in your head. being new to skateboarding your mind isn't used to moving side to side and flipping between the two. It often makes it really hard to firgure out how to do tricks. Where to look and turn is unatural at first.</p>
            <p>It helps if you can see it in your head first. Spend some time and think the trick through if that helps.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start to unwind. You want to stay centered over the leading set of wheels. Pivot around this point. It will happen automatically when you unwind so be centered over the truck.</li>
                <li>Lift the back wheels and pivot around the leading wheels. Notice that everything swings around pretty quickly.</li>
                <li>Hold up the wheels until you spin around 180.</li>
                <li>Let your wheels down and keep rolling.</li>
                <li>Crouch your knees to help regain your balance.</li>
                <li>Keep rolling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You did it!</p>
            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>Get used to riding switch. Get used to the way it feels to roll both ways on your skateboard.</p>
            <p>You are getting closer to some really good tricks. This is the first move that really feels like a trick when you first do it. Plus it look pretty cool to.</p>
            <p>Keep at it!</p>
